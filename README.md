## Rattan CSS Framework

This is Rattan CSS, a simple CSS framework for getting started quickly with theming.

## Features

* A stylesheet for printing
* Browser CSS reset
* Table reset
* Nice fonts for Ubuntu
* Notice, error and message styles
* Growing support for common form elements including those used in Django, django-uni-form and Drupal
* Tested in Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, IE7+
* No bloat

## Excluded by design

* Grid system. These things shouldn't be difficult to do in the first place. However, there *are* CSS definitions for #primary and #secondary.
* Typographic baseline. Not worth the hassle in my opinion.

## Setup

Include your code in your HTML head section like this:

    <!-- Rattan CSS -->
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="/css/rattan/rt.all.css" />
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="print" href="/css/rattan/rt.print.css" />

For everything else, look at the example folder and figure it out :)

## What's with the name?

Rattan is the name for various species of climbing palms that are **sturdy, light and flexible** and are widely used around the world, especially Southeast Asia, to make furniture.
