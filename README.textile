h1. Rattan CSS Framework

This is Rattan CSS, a simple CSS framework inspired by Blueprint and other CSS frameworks but minus the fat. 

h2. Features

* A stylesheet for printing
* Browser CSS reset
* Notice, error and message styles
* Growing support for common form elements including those used in Django, django-uni-form and Drupal
* No bloat
* Tested in Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, IE8, IE6
* The maximum layout width (which you can easily override), is 980px, instead of the common 960px to maximize the use of horizontal real estate

h2. Features left out deliberately

* Grid system - these things shouldn't be difficult to do in the first place - but there are CSS definitions for #primary and #secondary.
* Typographic baseline. Not worth the hassle in my opinion.

h2. Setup Instructions

Look at the example (index.html) and figure it out :)

h2. "Rattan"?

_The name for various species of climbing palms that are *sturdy, light and flexible* and are widely used around the world, especially Southeast Asia, to make furniture._
