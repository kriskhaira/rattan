h1. Rattan CSS Framework

Welcome to Rattan, a simple CSS framework inspired by Blueprint and other CSS frameworks but minus the fat. 

h2. Features

* A stylesheet for printing
* Browser CSS reset
* Form styles
* Notice, error and message style - great for development frameworks incl. Django and Ruby on Rails
* No bloat
* Tested in Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, IE8, IE6

h2. Features left out deliberately

* Grid system - because these things shouldn't be difficult to do in the first place. There is #primary and #secondary, though.
* Typographic baseline. Is it really worth the extra KB?

h2. Setup Instructions

Look at the example (index.html) and figure it out yourself. Go ahead, learn some HTML.

h2. "Rattan"?

_The name for various species of climbing palms that are *sturdy, light amd flexible* and are widely used in Asia to make furniture_
