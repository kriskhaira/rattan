h2. Features which Rattan does not or may never have

* No grid system - because these things shouldn't be difficult to do in the first place. There is #primary and #secondary, though.
* No typographic baseline. Is it really worth the extra KB?

Look at the example (index.html) and figure it out yourself. Go ahead, learn some HTML.
