h1. Rattan CSS Framework

Welcome to Rattan, a simple CSS framework inspired by Blueprint and other CSS frameworks but minus the fat. 

h2. Features

* A stylesheet for printing
* Browser CSS reset
* Form styles
* Notice, error and message style
* Growing support for HTML elements and selectors used in default Django (e.g. errorlist) and Drupal installations
* No bloat
* Tested in Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, IE8, IE6
* The maximum layout width (which you can easily override), is 980px, not 960px as used by most grid CSS frameworks. Why? Because 980px maximizes horizontal real estate more and you can easily make your own grid system with 980px.

h2. Features left out deliberately

* Grid system - because these things shouldn't be difficult to do in the first place. There is #primary and #secondary, though.
* Typographic baseline. Is it really worth the extra KB?

h2. Setup Instructions

Look at the example (index.html) and figure it out yourself. Go ahead, learn some HTML.

h2. "Rattan"?

_The name for various species of climbing palms that are *sturdy, light and flexible* and are widely used around the world, especially Southeast Asia, to make furniture._
